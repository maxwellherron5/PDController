# PD Controller
 PD controller implementation for the Pololu A* Board. A user is able to enter an input of ten waypoints, and the PD controller will then determine how much torque to apply to the servo motor, and in what direction, until it reaches all the desired waypoints. There is also a logging functionality to view key variables as the servo is running.
